## Running

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)/[Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [DOTNET SDK 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)/[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

Start SQL server 
```ps
podman compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d
```
You'll then have to manually run the scripts in your IDE of choice - [DBUp](https://dbup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or similar would be used to deploy the versioned sql scripts but it's out of scope for this.

For the API service, you can either build and run the docker file or you can simply run the below
```ps
dotnet run --launch-profile https --configuration Release --project .\src\Onyx.ProductManagement.Api\
```

Nagivate to `https://localhost:7154/swagger/index.html` to test out the API.


### Products API Service

The Products API hosts a RESTful service for managing product data and basic user authentication. It also exposes a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/) endpoint for easy exploration and testing in local and development environments.

#### Authentication

Most API endpoints require a valid **JWT Bearer Token** for authentication, **except** for `/health` endpoint.  
Generate one using the `/auth/{user}` endpoint.
Include the token in the `Authorization` header when making requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your-jwt-token}
```

Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```


## Endpoints

## Health Check

- `GET /health`  
  Simple endpoint to verify the service is running.
   _No authentication required._

  **Response codes:**
  - `200 OK` - Service is healthy and reachable.
  - `503 Service Unavailable` - Service is unhealthy or degraded.
 
  **Response example:**

  ```json
  {
    "status": "Healthy",
    "checks": [
      {
        "name": "api_status",
        "status": "Healthy",
        "description": "API is running.",
        "duration": 0.0000031
      },
      {
        "name": "products_db",
        "status": "Healthy",
        "description": null,
